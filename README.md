# expert_system
The expert system is a simple medical diagnosis tool implemented in Java Eclipse. It allows users to select symptoms related to a patient's condition and provides a list of possible diseases based on those symptoms.
Here's how it works:
The system presents a set of checkboxes representing different symptoms to the user.
The user selects the checkboxes that correspond to the symptoms the patient is experiencing.
When the user clicks the "Diagnose" button, the system compares the selected symptoms with a set of predefined rules.
Each rule consists of a set of symptoms associated with a specific disease.
The system checks if the selected symptoms match the symptoms in each rule.
If a rule's symptoms match the selected symptoms, the system adds the associated disease to a list of matches.
Finally, the system displays the list of diseases that match the selected symptoms to the user.
The expert system helps narrow down the possible diseases based on the symptoms selected by the user. It provides a quick and convenient way to get an initial idea of potential health issues. However, it is important to note that this system is a simplified example and may not encompass all possible diseases or account for complex medical conditions.
